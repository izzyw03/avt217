	<h4>Navigation </h4>
	
	<p> The navigation bar has all the information any viewer would need, complete with the menu, about/history of the resturant, and catering/contact information. The navigation on this website is easy because it is straight forward and clear, having two sets of buttons (located at the top and the middle of the page) for ordering online and for delivery. Since it's a resturant based site, the order button must be easily accessible for customers, as well as other services the resturant may offer. The location of the business and number is located first thing on the top of the wesbite. 
	</p>
	
	
	
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	
	<p> The usability on this website is easy and very clear, immediately displaying all the options available. When exploring the navigation bar, it shows where you are on the website by highlighting the category you clicked on in yellow vs. the regular white. It also lists at the top of the page underneath the title where you clicked (ex:"home/menu"), depending on where you are located within the website. It also does this when you are on mobile which is helpful because the navigation bar is hidden on mobile.
	
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	
	<p>The typography and hierarchy on this website is readable and easy to understand. For example, the menu displays the name of the item and price in the same color font, while the description of the item in smaller font and color is located in between the item name and price. Immediately I am drawn to read the item name first because it's located in a larger font at the top of the item description. They also include images for their menu items, allowing customers to quickly look over the menu and decide if the food looks appetizing or not.
	
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	
	<p> Overall, I really enjoy the style and look of this website. They include images for all their menu items, including a gallery section dedicated to just decor and popular food items from the resturant. The imagery provided makes me as a customer feel like I'm engaging with the resturant. I love the descriptions of the flavors and spices located on almost every page and how the resturant promises me authentic Indian cusine. It makes me feel curious about the resturant and food and seeing the images feels almost inviting to me. Seeing the images makes me feel like this resturant is proud of who they are and what they serve.
